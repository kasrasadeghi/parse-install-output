the result of this should be to uninstall one project from the output of the make install

specifically for ogre-1.9.1 on my machine, it should remove
/usr/local/include/OGRE
/usr/local/lib/*Ogre*
/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
/usr/local/lib/OGRE
(basically /usr/local/lib)
/usr/local/share/OGRE
/usr/local/bin/OgreMeshUpgrader
/usr/local/bin/OgreXMLConverter
/usr/local/bin/SampleBrowser
